Dependencies
  activesupport (3.1.1)
  rspec (2.7.0)

To run the tests simply run 'rspec' from the command line without any arguments.
The test runs the same exact exmple given in the instructions.

This code is a simple demonstration, it's not ment to be used in real applications. 
In a real application I would add error checks and validations.
